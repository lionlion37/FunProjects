_Hangman_

In this project I've programmed the well known guessing game 'hangman'. As a player you
can choose if you want to get a randomly chosen english or german word (word list from
this source: http://www.gwicks.net/dictionaries.htm) or if you want to set the word manually
(which mainly is, logically, for 2 players mode).

To play the game, execute it in the terminal. The only needed apt module is 'figlet'.
